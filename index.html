        <span class="myDescription">
            I started my IT career when I was 18 years old doing some work for people I know, managing to fix computers
            for them and asking for a little price. My professional path in IT started somewhere around 2008 when I
            worked for a local radio giving IT tech support there. I started wishing to work with something of IT when I
            was 9 to 10 years while watching a TV Show about video game testing works. I was amazed and as I liked to
            play video games, I made a goal in my life which was to work with games. After working with almost
            everything in IT that was possible in my city, I started working remotely as a Developer and I am living the
            dream. But a dream to be made true is to develop a game. I will pursue this dream sometime in the future.
